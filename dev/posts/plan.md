# Publishing & Visibility Plan

Lead with this framing: aigent implements the [Anthropic agent skill specification](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices) as a proper toolchain — spec compliance enforcer, developer experience multiplier, and quality gate. Not a wrapper — ecosystem infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- [x] **Publish to crates.io** — live at https://crates.io/crates/aigent; 80 downloads in 3 days with no promotion
- [x] **Create Homebrew tap** — `brew install wkusnierczyk/aigent/aigent` (https://github.com/wkusnierczyk/homebrew-aigent)
- [ ] **Record demo video** (2 min) — terminal recording with `asciinema` or `vhs`; reuse across channels
- [ ] **Write blog post / dev.to article** — walkthrough of building a skill from scratch with `aigent`
- [ ] **LinkedIn post** (planned for v0.6.0) — "the missing toolchain for AI agent skills"

## Anthropic channels

- [ ] **Email devrel@anthropic.com** — introduce aigent as a toolchain for their skill spec; link repo + demo
- [ ] **Anthropic Discord** — share in developer channels with a short intro + demo link
- [ ] **Anthropic developer forum** — post in showcase/community section
- [ ] **X post tagging @AnthropicAI / @alexalbert__** — Alex Albert (head of Claude relations) engages with developer tooling built on Claude
- [ ] **Claude Code Plugin Directory** — watch for marketplace launch; submit early

## Developer communities

- [ ] **r/ClaudeAI** — post with demo video/blog link; this audience wants tooling
- [ ] **r/rust** — Rust community appreciates well-crafted CLIs; focus on the Rust angle
- [ ] **Hacker News** — "Show HN: Rust CLI for building AI agent skills to the Anthropic spec"
- [ ] **Lobsters** — similar audience, less noisy
